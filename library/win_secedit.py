module: win_secedit
version_added: '2.3'
short_description: Manipulate local security policies via secedit
description:
    - Modifies key values for local security policies via secedit
options:
  category:
    description:
      - The category you wish to modify a value under. This can things like System Access, Event Audit, etc. If you supply an invalid category the module will error out and let you know what the valid categories are for that particular system. 
    required: true
    default: null
  key:
    description:
      - The key under the category for which you wish to modify the value. For example, under the System Access category there is a key MinimumPasswordAge that could be targeted. Just like with category, if an invalid key is specified, the module will error out and show what the valid keys for the given category are.
    required: true
    default: null
  value:
    description:
      - The value to assign to the key. 
    required: true
    default: null
author:
    - Jonathan Davila (@defionscode) 
notes:
    - If the target server is joined to a DC then it will error as any secedit modifications would be overwritten by GPO.
    - SecEdit does not error out when you try to modify a key value with an improper value, such as passing in a string when a valid value would be an integer.
    - Therefore, this module will attempt to configure secedit with any value supplied, then it does a second dump of secedit to see if the requested change persisted, if it did not then it errors out, otherwise it continues as normal.
